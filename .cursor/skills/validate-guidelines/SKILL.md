# Validate Guidelines

## When to use

- User proposes or has made changes to `runner/models/guidelines.ts` and wants to ensure they don't regress other models
- User says "validate the guideline changes" or "run the guideline validation"
- Before committing guideline edits, to confirm improvements or no-regression across sonnet, opus, gemini, chatgpt (or a subset)

## Overview

Guideline changes are validated by running evals twice per model: once with the **current** (before) guidelines and once with the **proposed** (after) guidelines. Results are compared; any eval that passed before and fails after is a regression. The goal is to ensure changes improve or at least do not regress scores across multiple models.

## Step 1: Identify the change

Determine which guideline sections were modified in `runner/models/guidelines.ts` (e.g. `function_guidelines`, `query_guidelines`, `file_storage_guidelines`) and the intent (new rule, clarification, token compaction).

## Step 2: Build before and after guideline files

- **Before**: Current committed guidelines. Generate by running `bun run buildRelease.ts` and use `dist/AGENTS.md`, or render compact guidelines to a temp file. If the repo is in a clean state, `dist/AGENTS.md` after build is the "before" snapshot.
- **After**: Guidelines with the proposed changes. Either:
  - Temporarily apply the proposed edits to `runner/models/guidelines.ts`, run `bun run buildRelease.ts`, copy `dist/AGENTS.md` to a temp path (e.g. `guideline-validation/after.md`), then revert the file; or
  - Write the proposed full guideline markdown to a temp file (e.g. by building from a branch or a copy of the file).

Ensure both paths are absolute or relative to the repo root and that the script can read them.

## Step 3: Select target evals

Use the mapping below to choose a `--filter` regex or omit it for the full suite.

| Guideline section | Suggested TEST_FILTER (regex) |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| `function_guidelines` (http, validators, registration, calling, pagination) | `000-fundamentals\|006-clients` or full |
| `validator_guidelines` | `000-fundamentals/009` |
| `schema_guidelines` | `001-data_modeling` |
| `typescript_guidelines` | Omit (run all) |
| `full_text_search_guidelines` | `002-queries/009\|002-queries/020` |
| `query_guidelines` | `002-queries` |
| `mutation_guidelines` | `003-mutations` |
| `action_guidelines` | `004-actions` |
| `scheduling_guidelines` | `000-fundamentals/003\|000-fundamentals/004` |
| `file_storage_guidelines` | `000-fundamentals/007\|004-actions/004\|004-actions/005` |

- **Targeted change** (e.g. one section): use a filter that matches the evals most likely affected.
- **Broad change** (e.g. wording across many sections): omit `--filter` to run all evals.

## Step 4: Select models

Default set (preferred for validation): `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-6`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`, `gpt-5.2-codex`.

Check which API keys are set in `.env` (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`). The script skips models whose provider key is missing and prints a warning. Use a subset if some keys are unavailable; at least two models are recommended.

## Step 5: Run the validation script

Do **not** set `CONVEX_EVAL_URL` or `CONVEX_AUTH_TOKEN` so results stay local.

```bash
bun run validate:guidelines --before <path-to-before.md> --after <path-to-after.md> --models claude-sonnet-4-5,claude-opus-4-6,gemini-3-pro-preview,gpt-5.2-codex
```

With an eval filter:

```bash
bun run validate:guidelines --before <before.md> --after <after.md> --models claude-sonnet-4-5,gpt-5.2-codex --filter "002-queries"
```

Optional: `--output <path>` to write the JSON summary to a specific file. By default it is written to `guideline-validation/results/<timestamp>.json`.

The script runs each model sequentially: first all evals with "before" guidelines, then all evals with "after" guidelines. Pass/fail is collected and deltas are computed.

## Step 6: Parse and report results

The script prints:

1. A **comparison table**: per-model before pass count, after pass count, delta, number of regressions, number of improvements.
2. **Regressions**: evals that passed before and failed after (by model).
3. **Improvements**: evals that failed before and passed after (by model).
4. A **verdict** line: either "REGRESSIONS DETECTED" or "Safe to commit."

Read the script output and present to the user:

- The summary table and verdict.
- If there are regressions: list them and recommend reverting or narrowing the guideline change; optionally run analyze-eval on a regression to see why it failed.
- If there are no regressions: recommend committing the guideline change; mention any improvements.

## Step 7: Recommend next steps

- **No regressions, with or without improvements**: Safe to commit the guideline changes. Optionally update relevant `GAPS.txt` if the change addresses a known gap.
- **Any regressions**: Do not commit. Suggest reverting the change or narrowing it (e.g. only add the new rule to a subsection that doesn’t affect the regressed eval). Re-run validation after adjusting.
- **Unclear or noisy**: If only one model regresses one eval, consider re-running that model to check for flakiness, or run the full suite once more.

## Reference: Script usage

```
bun run validate:guidelines --before <path> --after <path> --models <m1,m2,...> [--filter <regex>] [--output <path>]
```

- `--before`, `--after`: Paths to guideline markdown files (current vs proposed).
- `--models`: Comma-separated model names from `runner/models/index.ts` (e.g. `gpt-5.2-codex`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`).
- `--filter`: Optional regex on eval `category/name` (e.g. `005-idioms` or `002-queries/015`).
- `--output`: Optional path for the JSON summary file.

API keys are loaded from `.env` via dotenv (see AGENTS.md). The script does not report to Convex.
